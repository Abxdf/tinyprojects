# tinyprojects
I will be uploading all the tiny projects that I develop which can be help to save a lot of time some times.

#tinyproject 1 (wrong_line_index.py)
This file can be used for checking at which line does two files being compared differ. 
I made this so It will be easy for me to compare my original output with the output of the correct output(HackerRank).
This will print the line number where the two files differ.
