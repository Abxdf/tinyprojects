# tinyprojects
I will be uploading all the tiny projects that I develop which can be help to save a lot of time some times.

#tinyproject 1 (wrong_line_index.py)
This file can be used for checking at which line does two files being compared differ. 
I made this so It will be easy for me to compare my original output with the output of the correct output(HackerRank).
This will print the line number where the two files differ.

#tinyproject 2(addBigints.cpp)
This file consists of a function 'addBigints' which can be used to add two big integers in c++. Big integers are stored in string format. Function accepts two arguments and returns the sum of two arguments.

#tinyproject 3(mulBigints.cpp)
This file consists of a function 'mulBigints' which can be used to multiply two big integers in c++. Big integers are stored in string format. Function accepts two arguments and returns the sum of two arguments.

#tinyproject 4(factorialBigints.cpp)
This file is used for generating factorial of a number, without worrying about the integer over flows as it uses strings to store data and mulBigints function for generating factorial of a number.  
The 75th factorial, which is calculated from this program is 
24809140811395398091946477116594033660926243886570122837795894512655842677572867409443815424000000000000000000

#tinyproject 5(mulBigintRecursionOptimized.cpp)
Similar to the tinyproject 3, with reduced time complexity. It works on the divide and conquer strategy. This algorithm is explained nicely by 'Tim	Roughgarden' in his first week class of 'Design and Analysis of Algorithms Coursera course.'

#tinyproject 6(subBigint.cpp)
This file consists of a function 'subBigints' which can be used to substract two big integers in c++. Big integers are stored in string format. Function accepts two arguments and returns the sum of two arguments.
