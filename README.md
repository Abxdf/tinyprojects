# tinyprojects
I will be uploading all the tiny projects that I develop which can be help to save a lot of time some times.

#tinyproject 1 (wrong_line_index.py)
This file can be used for checking at which line does two files being compared differ. 
I made this so It will be easy for me to compare my original output with the output of the correct output(HackerRank).
This will print the line number where the two files differ.

#tinyproject 2(addBigints.cpp)
This file consists of a function 'addBigints' which can be used to add two big integers in c++. Big integers are stored in string format. Function accepts two arguments and returns the sum of two arguments.

#tinyproject 3(mulBigints.cpp)
This file consists of a function 'mulBigints' which can be used to multiply two big integers in c++. Big integers are stored in string format. Function accepts two arguments and returns the sum of two arguments.
